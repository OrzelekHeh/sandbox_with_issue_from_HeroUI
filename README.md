## To reproduce that issue simply do:
- clone repository
- run: ```npm run dev ```
- open website on mobile version
- scroll to bottom of page
- try to tap one of the "Select"'s which are on root page

 #### Page will automatically jump to have space or something, then if you don't scroll you can actually open that select, but when select is on bottom of page it's impossible to open it
